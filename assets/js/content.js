Other flu treatments, such as Tamiflu, attack the virus after it has replicated in host cells; they work by making it harder for daughter viruses to escape from the host cell. Xofluza, on the other hand, attacks the flu virus at the early stage that Krug's research illuminated, blocking flu before it is able to create daughter viruses. \"It stops the virus cold,\" Krug said. \"It can't do anything.\"",

What’s needed are new, better, more universal ways to get drugs where we need them and keep them away from where we don’t. McPherson’s solution, on which he’s been working for almost 20 years, is a class of carriers called echogenic liposomes. They are essentially tiny submarines, with an outer lipid shell, that carry different types of drugs throughout the bloodstream.",

But then there is a secondary sequence of reactions as the body’s innate immune system responds to the damaged tissue, generating brain inflammation that ends up killing neurons.” Cox’s research is centered around using stem cell therapy to limit this collateral inflammatory damage that follows the immediate trauma of brain injury, so that some of the damaged tissue has a chance to recover.",

		subhead: "It was a few days after Thanksgiving in 2001, and Paula Offenhauser was rummaging for her plastic Christmas tree in the attic. Realizing she needed scissors to free the decorative shrub from its packaging, she headed back down to the floor below. The attic ladder was one of those steep, narrow, precarious ones. Offenhauser tripped at the top and tumbled down, her body crumpling at the bottom, wedged between the ladder and the door opposite the bottom rung. After that, she doesn’t remember much. “I went to the attic, and I woke up in a hospital six days later,” said Offenhauser. She hit the back of her head on either the wall or the ladder––the bloodstains were unclear. Her 25-month-old daughter answered the phone when Offenhauser’s sister called an hour later, and was able to communicate enough to prompt an immediate 911 call.",

		subhead: "Dr. Susan Mooberry is studying the potential anti-cancer properties of the Bat Flower (Tacca chantrieri), a tropical plant that is cultivated for sale as an ornamental. This flower yields a class of compounds that have effectively treated multiple-drug-resistant tumors in mice.The compounds stabilize microtubules, which are cellular structures that function as railroad tracks moving cargo within cells. Cancers co-opt these railroad tracks for their own rampant growth. Microtubule stabilizers stop the abnormal cargo movements, which stresses the cancer cell and causes it to die.",

        subhead: "A one-two combo punch using two currently available drugs could be an effective treatment for the majority of lung cancers, a study by scientists with UT Southwestern’s Simmons Cancer Center shows. Researchers found that a combination of drugs, one targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and one targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF), effectively blocks the cancer from using TNF as an escape route. Using a mouse model, the researchers showed that when TNF is also blocked, the cancer becomes sensitive to EGFR treatment. The latest findings build on previous work showing that the same combination of drugs was successful in a mouse model of glioblastoma, a deadly type of brain cancer.",

People from various sectors wanted advice on drug development, and Frantz, with his background in commercial drug production, seemed a potential source. At Merck, he and his colleagues had produced the drugs that would be used in chemical trials. It gave him the “soup to nuts” experience regarding how drug discovery worked from the industrial side. “There was so much interest,” said Frantz, “that it seemed there was more to be done than just offer advice.”",
