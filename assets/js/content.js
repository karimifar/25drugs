		subhead: "It was a few days after Thanksgiving in 2001, and Paula Offenhauser was rummaging for her plastic Christmas tree in the attic. Realizing she needed scissors to free the decorative shrub from its packaging, she headed back down to the floor below. The attic ladder was one of those steep, narrow, precarious ones. Offenhauser tripped at the top and tumbled down, her body crumpling at the bottom, wedged between the ladder and the door opposite the bottom rung. After that, she doesn’t remember much. “I went to the attic, and I woke up in a hospital six days later,” said Offenhauser. She hit the back of her head on either the wall or the ladder––the bloodstains were unclear. Her 25-month-old daughter answered the phone when Offenhauser’s sister called an hour later, and was able to communicate enough to prompt an immediate 911 call.",

As a result, treatments tend to be supportive rather than reparative. Dr. Charles Cox and his team are working to change that. “Traumatic brain injury is really two things: a primary injury and a secondary injury,” says Cox, Professor of Pediatric Surgery at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston. “The initial impact––on the ground or with an object––is the primary kinetic injury, and nothing can be done about that kinetic disruption of tissue. But then there is a secondary sequence of reactions as the body’s innate immune system responds to the damaged tissue, generating brain inflammation that ends up killing neurons.” Cox’s research is centered around using stem cell therapy to limit this collateral inflammatory damage that follows the immediate trauma of brain injury, so that some of the damaged tissue has a chance to recover.",

And already human trials have demonstrated that Xofluza patients have a much lower viral load in the first three days of treatment than Tamiflu patients and stop shedding flu virus in about a day, compared to about three days with Tamiflu.",
