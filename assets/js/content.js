        subhead: "A one-two combo punch using two currently available drugs could be an effective treatment for the majority of lung cancers, a study by scientists with UT Southwestern’s Simmons Cancer Center shows. Researchers found that a combination of drugs, one targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and one targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF), effectively blocks the cancer from using TNF as an escape route. Using a mouse model, the researchers showed that when TNF is also blocked, the cancer becomes sensitive to EGFR treatment. The latest findings build on previous work showing that the same combination of drugs was successful in a mouse model of glioblastoma, a deadly type of brain cancer.",

The disease has been endemic to Latin America, affecting 6 million to 7 million people, but it is rapidly spreading through the United States, Europe and other nonendemic regions as a result of globalization. Yet, there is no fully effective drug and no clinical vaccine. Researchers at UTEP will conduct a phase II clinical trial in Bolivia with new regimens of the drugs benznidazole and nifurtimox.",

Microglia is a type of cell that is majorly found throughout the brain. The proposed nanodrug can be used to directly deliver an anti-HIV drug specifically to the inflammatory areas of the brain where most of the infected microglia and the virus are present. ",

They’ve tried blood pressure medications, antioxidant vitamins, salt restriction, aspirin, fish oil, and calcium, all with little or no effect. A new drug that dramatically reduced the risks would be a unicorn under any circumstances. That the new drug might in fact be an old drug, proven safe in many studies and already sold cheaply as a generic, would be extraordinary. ",

Yet, here he witnessed a breakthrough that changed the narrative, a realization that after years of despair and depression, a lifesaving treatment for his condition was no longer a far-fetched dream.“It’s unbelievable,” Mr. Dupree, 26, said as he looked at his cells during a recent visit to a UT Southwestern gene-editing lab. “This could save so many lives one day.”",

This was a big moment for the sisters. Both had been diagnosed with a rare genetic disease that was slowly killing 10-year-old Chrissy and would next take aim at Amanda. Several months prior Chrissy could not even wiggle a toe, much less stand up – the rapid deterioration of her nervous system forcing her into a wheelchair by age 8. Then, a marvel of medicine.",

But the quantities needed to do so, right now, may kill the patient.” This is true, he says, not just of injectable drugs, but of pills, inhalants, and every other method of drug delivery. What’s needed are new, better, more universal ways to get drugs where we need them and keep them away from where we don’t. McPherson’s solution, on which he’s been working for almost 20 years, is a class of carriers called echogenic liposomes. They are essentially tiny innerspace submarines, with an outer lipid shell, that carry different types of drugs throughout the bloodstream.",
