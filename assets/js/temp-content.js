        shortTitle: "Stalling Lung Cancer",
        subhead: "In a preclinical study, biologist Dr. Li Zhang and her team showed that the expansion of lung tumors in mice slowed when access to heme — the oxygen-binding molecule in hemoglobin — was restricted. The researchers also showed that those same cancers grew faster when more heme was available than normal. With an eye toward exploiting the cancer’s heme dependency, two of Zhang’s graduate students then engineered and extensively characterized new molecules aimed at starving the cancer cells of the molecule that allows them to proliferate so quickly.",

        subhead: "”We are completely driven by unmet needs we see in the patients that come to MD Anderson for help,” says Phil Jones, Ph.D., vice president of Therapeutics Discovery. ”Guided by the expertise of our world-class clinicians, our efforts begin with the patient and their cancer. The Therapeutics Discovery model is designed to develop new treatments to meet their needs. Unlike typical pharmaceutical companies, Therapeutics Discovery was built within the walls of MD Anderson, placing drug development expertise in unparalleled proximity to patients and leading physicians. It's a recipe for success that already is yielding promising results. And at the heart of it all are more than 100 scientists, driven by a passion to see their work one day save a patient's life.”",
